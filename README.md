### Overview

Analyzing Year-over-Year (YoY) sales changes is crucial for understanding business growth and performance. Implementing conditional color formatting based on YoY sales changes enhances the clarity and impact of the visual analysis. This project involves creating a Power BI dashboard that leverages DAX functions to apply conditional color formatting to the backgrounds of visuals and bars, highlighting significant changes in sales.

### Objectives

1. **YoY Sales Change Analysis**:
   - **Objective**: Analyze sales changes on a Year-over-Year basis to identify growth and decline trends.
   - **Details**: Provide a clear comparison of sales figures from the current year to the previous year, highlighting percentage changes.

2. **Conditional Color Formatting**:
   - **Objective**: Enhance visual clarity and impact using conditional color formatting based on YoY sales changes.
   - **Details**: Use DAX functions to create rules for color formatting, applying them to the backgrounds of visuals and bars to visually distinguish areas of significant growth or decline.

3. **Visual Representation of Sales Data**:
   - **Objective**: Present sales data in an intuitive and visually appealing manner.
   - **Details**: Utilize various visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, and tables to display sales data, with conditional color formatting indicating performance levels.

4. **Branch and Category Performance Analysis**:
   - **Objective**: Compare the performance of different branches and product categories based on YoY sales changes.
   - **Details**: Visualize the YoY sales changes across different branches and product categories, identifying top and underperforming segments.

5. **Insightful Tooltips**:
   - **Objective**: Provide detailed insights through interactive tooltips.
   - **Details**: Implement tooltips that display additional information about YoY sales changes, helping users to understand the context behind the numbers.

6. **Dashboard Interactivity**:
   - **Objective**: Ensure the dashboard is interactive and user-friendly.
   - **Details**: Incorporate filters, slicers, and drill-down capabilities to allow users to explore the data at different levels of granularity.

### Challenges

- **DAX Function Creation**: Develop DAX functions that accurately calculate YoY sales changes and determine the appropriate color formatting.
- **Data Accuracy**: Ensure the accuracy of YoY comparisons by properly handling data for different time periods.
- **Conditional Formatting Application**: Apply conditional color formatting effectively across various visuals without compromising clarity.
- **User Engagement**: Design interactive elements that enhance user engagement and facilitate easy data exploration.

### Expected Outcomes

- **Clear YoY Sales Insights**: Provide a clear understanding of Year-over-Year sales changes, highlighting significant growth and decline areas.
- **Enhanced Visual Impact**: Use conditional color formatting to make the visual analysis more impactful and easier to interpret.
- **Branch and Category Performance**: Identify which branches and product categories are performing well or need attention based on YoY sales changes.
- **Detailed Insights**: Offer detailed insights through interactive tooltips, enhancing the user's understanding of the data.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard that allows users to explore the data efficiently.
